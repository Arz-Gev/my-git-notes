1 - GitHub is a great tool for team collaboration.

2 - It does all the connecting work: you can do your part and then merge your branch into the main project using a PR (pull request).

3 - In general, you can't work on a big project with a big team without a helper tool like GitHub â€” or at least it will be way harder.

4 - For a smoother experience, it's better to connect your GitHub and local Git using SSH.
